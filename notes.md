### Scope of analysis

* Primary interest: Computer software for analysing and visualising data 
* Side interest: Digital tools that help with research (e.g. referencing, document editing, graphics editing) 
* Out: Computer models (e.g. climate models, biological models, economic models)
* Out: Physical hardware (e.g. microscopes, scanners)
* Out: Data search tools (e.g. Trove)

### Reasons to read paper

* Researchers: Get an idea of tools you could use
* Educators: What/how to teach digital research skills

### Take away message/s

There are so many tools you couldn't possibly provide support and training for all of them.
The aim should therefore be to teach generic skills / best practices that people can use to teach themselves different tools.
Having said that, if possible it's nice to deliver training on generic skills using a widely used tool
(i.e. so people can learn the tool and skills at the same time).
This paper gives excellent guidance on what tools to focus on for different disciplines/audiences.

The skills / best practices that cover all the tools on the posters can be broadly grouped as follows:
1. Discipline specific knowledge/skills (e.g. MRI analysis software)
2. Research statistics
3. Data visualisation best practices
4. Programming best practices
5. Spreadsheet best practices

Faculties offer (1) and (2) (the latter possibly in collaboration with Maths & Stats Department),
which leaves (3), (4) and (5) to departments like Research Platform Services.
We do programming best practices well (e.g. Software Carpentry),
spreadsheet best practices well (e.g. Data Carpentry),
but there seems to be a gap in what we offer for data visualisation best practices.

The plethora of closed and/or paid and/or no scripting tools is a barrier to open science that doesn't get much attention.
