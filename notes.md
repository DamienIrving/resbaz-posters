### Take away messages

There are so many tools you couldn't possibly provide support and training for all of them.
The aim should therefore be to teach generic skills that people can use to teach themselves
(e.g. programming best practices, spreadsheet best practices).  
* This is why Software Carpentry has been so successful  
* Many of the tools are a command line tool, excel plugin, Matlab toolbox, output corresponding Python code (e.g. GIS packages)

The plethora of closed and/or paid tools is a barrier to open science that doesn't get much attention.

### Data analysis

* Group into profiles for each discipline

### Reasons to read paper

* Researchers: Get an idea of tools you could use
* Educators: What/how to teach digital research skills

## Classes to cover all the stuff

* Discipline specific (e.g. MRI analysis)
* Research statistics
* Data visualisation best practices
* Programming best practices
* Spreadsheet best practices
