# Data science tools

i.e. Tools used for data analysis and/or visualisation.

The hierarchy is as follows:

### 1. General purpose programming languages

* Python, R, C++, MATLAB, etc
* unix shell, Make (i.e. workflow coordination)

(Technically you could break this down further because Make runs in a shell environment, etc, but I'm trying to keep it simple)

### 2. General data science tools

* general
  * matplotlib, xarray, IDL
* spreadsheets
  * Excel, etc
* databases
  * Microsoft Access, MySQL, etc
* file manipulation
  * NCO
* qualitative data
  * NVivo, leximancer
* statistics
  * SPSS, Stata, SciPy
* spatial
  * ArcGIS, CARTO

### 3. Discipline specific tools

* Astronomy
* Bioinformatics
* Biological image processing
* Chemistry
* Climate
* Genomics
* Geographic image processing
* Medical image processing
* Morphometrics
* Nanoelectronics
* Phonetics
* Phylogenetics
* Protein sequencing
* Psychology
* Social sciences
* Statistical modelling

A tool in lower category may function as a stand alone application and/or
provide the ability to operate within a tool/environment in a higher category.
