## University of Melbourne Recommendations

Based on a review of the training Research Platform Services currently offers
and the digital research tools identified in the ResBaz posters
(see [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ucknHn9pRRrX7puC4jZRjAPvDW2pFOnYu88_-KZOMME/edit#slide=id.p)
for details), here are our recommendations:

**1. The current focus on trainings in R, Python and MATLAB is justified by the poster data**

Training in this space could be enhanced by recruitment of Research Community Coordinators from the following disciplines:
* R: biological sciences (ecology, zoology, biochemisty and cell biology, genetics); psychology; mathematical sciences; environmetal sciences
* Python: atmospheric and ocean sciences; astronomical and space sciences; language, communication and culture
* MATLAB: engineering; neurosciences

**2. Spreadsheet usage is widespread and training on best practices could be added to the training catalogue**

[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) run courses that start with an introduction to spreadsheet best practices
and discussion/exploration of their limitations,
which leads into an introduction to more advanced options (e.g. dataframe contructs in R or Python)
for overcoming those limitations
(e.g. see the [spreadsheet lesson for ecologists](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/)).
This might be a good approach for Research Platform Services,
possibly integrating with spreadsheet courses that the library offers.

**3. There are a small number of highly popular tools that do not appear in the training catalogue**

ArcGIS, SPSS and NVivo are the most glaring omissions from our current course offerings.
The Data Carpentry approach could be taken to teaching these tools also:
* An introduction to ArcGIS best practices and limitations could lead into an introduction to the Python, R or MATLAB libraries used for working with maps and geographic information
* An introduction to SPSS best practices and limitations could lead into an introduction to the Python, R or MATLAB libraries used for research statistics
* An introduction to NVivo best practices and limitations could lead into our existing course on using the NLTK Python library for analysing text

**4. An outreach officer (with broad, generic data science skills) could be employed to explore the needs of research faculties/disciplines that have had little engagement with Research Platform Services**

The vast majority of researchers taking our courses are from science, medicine and engineering.

There is huge potential for us to expand into areas such as law, education, arts, business/economics/commerce and agricultural and vetinary sciences,
particularly as data science becomes a more critical skill in these areas.
